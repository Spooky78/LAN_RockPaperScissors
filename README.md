# LAN_RockPaperScissors

Pygame project I made during holidays to understand the fundementals of client and server relationships by making a rock, paper, scissors game, where the clients can join on any computer conneccted to the LAN network. This also gave me an oportunity to use python, which I have not used for anything major in a while.

***To configure to run  on your network, you need to change the server string in near the top of the network.py and server.py files to your ip address.***
